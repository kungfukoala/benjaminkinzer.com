Flatsound is a poet, songwriter, musician and photographer. *I Clung to You Hoping We'd Both Drown* is like a memory of good and bad. Mitch Welling contacted me several years back about using one of my Polaroids from a series of Central Oregon lakes I had on Flickr. Some how Mitch entrusted me witht he design too. At first we only were designing for a CD, but recently Mitch returned to see if I would like to translate the CD artwork to Vinyl. I was loosing a few panels, but gaining a larger canvas. Inspired by how Tori Amos reworked her collection of songs for [Tales of a Librarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_a_Librarian), I decided to rework the artwork slightly for the Vinyl.
