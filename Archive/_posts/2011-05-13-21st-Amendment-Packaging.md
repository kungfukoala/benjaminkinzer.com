21st Amendment Brewery is a loaded concept. You could possibly go many different directions. What we really wanted to capture with this brand was the craft beer can be served in a can. But how when cans are only used for mass-produced lagers do you convince the beer world 21st Amendment Brewery brews craft beer for the can and actually cares about the quality. The fun suprise about 21st Amendment is there personalities also shined within the branding. We developed two lines, the main line which is what you see here and the Insurrection Series which was for limited release beers.
