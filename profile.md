<div class="who">
<p>We are born from creation and there is no escaping the desire to create. In holographic theory we are asked to look at the whole and not the individual particles. My approach to design is similar in that I look for the sum of the indivdual moving parts. I'm not a surgeon or a psychologist or even an anthropologist. I choose to work with a variety of people, ask questions and listen well. Instead of dissecting a project, you take a moment to look at it from different perspectives. This provides a map for what we are creating together.</p>

<p>Although it appears that I'm a magician at times or a technical expert, that is merely the fluff. I'm taking every story, word, number, experience and finding the different perspectives that will eventually tell the whole story. To reach these points of wholeness we cannot merely sit idle. Iterative design allows us understand our people and make key refinements over time.</p>
