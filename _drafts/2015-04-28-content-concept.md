I honestly believe design is useless without content. After all design is about communication and designers have been given the opportunity to communicate visually with intelligence and beauty.



This is part of a series "[Design in the Browser]" redesign of [benjaminkinzer.com] 


Here is a content outline of where I'm headed with the website. Best place to start any projects is by asking a few questions of what we are hoping this website will do or solve. 

One of my favorite sites to visit is [KELLERHOUSE](http://www.kellerhouse.com/); it feels like a print brochure. It has both work and what appears to be conceptual work that was never selected. I love this approach as I feel the that web technologies have progressed enough that we can now have a little more visual fun. I also love that you can tell stories visually with ease. The border between print and online has been desolved and we can now blend the two worlds. Don't get me wrong I still love picking up a magazine or a good book. [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6202773-benjamin-kinzer). Another inpsiration was [Made You Look]() by Stefen Sagmiester and how he revealed personal journal entries along with showcasing his work. I'm kind of hoping I can merge these two worlds and create something fun for people to view and read. 

Let's start with our content outline.

As you can see it's a pretty simple website.

**Home**
Our home will be a typical collection of posts, but using more imagery and less text. 

**Posts**
By selection a post you will be presented with that post and related posts such as quotes, backstories, concept sketches, and the final work.

**Profile**
The majority of the content on this page will be static. However, I typically have a hard time meeting new people due to some fear of rejection or awkward silence. I've come up with a new tool hopefully to break the ice and I wanted to include it on my website. It's based of children's alphabet books (Could be happening as I have read many of these to my son). 

Example:
B is for Bunny - M first pet was a bunny named Thumper. Actually, I had a few fish before Thumper, but I couldn't keep them alive long enough to really remember their names. Still unsure why my parents thought I was fit to raise a bunny after so many toilet flushing sessions. Plus Thumper Kendall makes a great striper name alias. :)



My current thinking is you click on a post and it goes to a category page that displays all the backstories for the project. Here's the hierarchy I see currently:
1. 

The current usability problem I have is sorting these categories? If I have multiple posts that are added at a later date the final work could be pushed to the bottom. One thought is to create a category called "final" which would always site at the top of the list.
