<div class="introduction">
  Help our friend loose some weight by adjusting your browser window size. Or for or mobile and tablet friends rotate your device. Almost like squats.
</div>

Since we are designing in the browser and we will eventually have to deal with images and Art Direction, let's look at one of our best tools for making sure the experience is seemless as possible across all platforms. 

###Art Direction and Responsive Design




We will be using SASS to handle media queries. Currently using Media Quieries by Rafael.



How did we do this?

If you are new to SASS I recommend reading: Sass for beginners

So let's compare what happens with our image from Unknown Truths and our Loose Weight image. As you can see the image for loose weight remains large on smaller screens. Where as your skeleton friend on Unknown Truths get teeny tiny (book reference). This is a great example of art direction in the age of responsive design.
