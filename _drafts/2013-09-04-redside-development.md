Back in 2011 I had the opportunity to design [Flatsound's](http://www.flatsound.org/) [CD]({% post_url 2011-02-11-flatsound %}). 2015, four years later Mitch of Flatsound asked me to translate the CD album to Vinyl. We would be loosing two panels, but gaining a larger canvas area. Even though this is not a collection of Flatsound's greatest hits, I was inspired by Tori Amos on how she reworked her collection of songs for [Tales of a Librarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_a_Librarian). I wanted to take advantage of the larger canvas a 12 inch Vinyl and rework the design to reflect my current state of mind, while still paying homage to the orignal design.
